# mail_automation_system
 * All colleges whether Government or private have a unit working for proper management of mails or couriers that they recieve. Some of these couriers are not so important but some are and loss of these might result in great loss. To manage and sort out this problem all colleges should have their own mail automation system.
 * The main function of this system is to replace the old way of notifying students ie displaying a piece of paper on notice board which they usually ignore.Instead of showing a list this will let us to notify students through emails. To enable it Pytessaract is used.The process starts with  uploading photo oflist on website instead of displaying it on notice board.Pytessaract will extract informaton using registration no. and will help to sort out students whose mails have been arrived.Now the main concern is the efficiency of Pytessaract which is not as great to get exact result every time.To remove this addition of speech recoginition is done(figuring out how to do it).Now the scene is that we take a photo of the list and get information using Pytessaract and using speech api we also get information through reading list aloud.Then we compare the information so to get prepare afinal digital list of persons whose mails have been get information through reading list aloud.Then we compare the information so to get prepare a final digital list of persons whose mails have been arrived.We compare this list to the student information	database and extract emails.Now only one thing is remaining ie sending notification through emails.Amail is send to students notifying them to collect their items.
